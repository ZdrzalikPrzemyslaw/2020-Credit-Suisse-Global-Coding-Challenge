Emilia, a quantitative researcher, predicts how the closing share price of a stock moves over time.
She wants to find the maximum possible profit of a stock over a given period of time, using
only one buy and one sell operation according to a given sequence of predicted share prices.

## Constraints

- All of the predicted share prices are positive integers.

## Input format

- The first integer input is the number of predicted days.
- The subsequent integer input is a sequence of positive integers. The element at position i refers to
the predicted share price of a given stock on the ith day.

## Output format

- An integer which is the maximum possible profit with only one buy and one sell operation
