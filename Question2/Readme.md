# [Question 2 - Profit Maximization - Extended](https://github.com/ZdrzalikPrzemyslaw/2020-Credit-Suisse-Global-Coding-Challenge/blob/master/.github/Global%20Coding%20Challenge_ex_2.pdf)

Emilia can now use multiple buy and sell operations over a given period of time.
Given a sequence of predicted share prices, she wants to find the maximum possible profit while
using the smallest number of trading operations throughout the given time.


## Constraints

- Short selling is not allowed.
- All of the predicted share prices are positive integers.
- You can only execute one buy or one sell operation of a share on a given day.
- Only one share can be bought or sold at a time.
- You are not required to execute a buy or sell operation every day.


## Input format

- The first integer input is the number of predicted days.
- The subsequent integer input is a sequence of positive integers. The element at position i refers to
the predicted share price of a given stock on the ith day.


## Output format

- An integer that is the maximum profit using the smallest number of trading operations throughout
